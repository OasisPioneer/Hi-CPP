## About

The original intention of writing this book is to help myself gain a deeper understanding and retention of key concepts during my C++ learning journey, while also organizing a more systematic C++ learning path.

* This book is divided into four parts:
  * **Core Language Features**: Covers C++ basic syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP), and other core concepts.
  * **Network Programming**: Includes network communication, asynchronous I/O, and Boost.Asio.
  * **Database Programming**: Focuses on data storage, database statements, and related practices.
  * **Graphics Frameworks**: Explores both Text-based User Interfaces (TUI) and Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).
